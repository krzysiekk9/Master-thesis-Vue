# Vue.js benchmark app

This web application was created for benchmark testing. 

For my master thesis, I compared two JS frameworks - React and Vue.js. 

The applications were coded in both frameworks to be as similar as possible, and then tested for performance.

The app generates tables and renders images (I measured rendering times in both frameworks).
